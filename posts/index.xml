on my background during meetings has sparked some interesting
conversations, and a colleague suggested I bring something for the
team, I like the idea right away and after some thinking I decided on
making a Maker Chip, inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4bMm8w1rZY">Zack
Freedman&rsquo;s</a> video about
it.</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;ll share all the resources I used as well as some photos/images
from the creation process.</p>
<p>If you want to print it, <a href="EAH-2025-Text-Bottom-full-plate.3mf">here</a>
is the 3D model.</p>
<p>3D printing was not enough, I also had to put my Flipper Zero to some
good use, so I embedded a NFC tag that when scanned links to this
post. <a href="eah-2025-nfc-tag.nfc">Here</a> is the Flipper NFC file.</p>
