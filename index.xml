on my background during meetings has sparked some interesting
conversations, and a colleague suggested I bring something for the
team, I like the idea right away and after some thinking I decided on
making a Maker Chip, inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4bMm8w1rZY">Zack
Freedman&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> video about
it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here I&amp;rsquo;ll share all the resources I used as well as some photos/images
from the creation process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Talks</title><link>https://tiago.life/talks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 21:23:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://tiago.life/talks/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="advanced-testing-techniques-tips-and-tricks-for-testing">Advanced testing techniques: Tips and tricks for testing&lt;/h2>
